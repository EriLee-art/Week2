            <p>Eric Lee is the creator of this site and is a lifelong gamer with a passion for good game experiences. After spending many years watching news sites review games, they noticed a pattern! These sites <b>SUCKED</b> at actually informing consumers about the product purchases they are making. Thus, Eric took it upon themself to fix a longstanding problem with games media, the overly relied upon 0-10 scoring system.</p>
